## Introduction
Mellow Heeler observes WiFi access points at predetermined intervals (default of one minute), using a dedicated [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).  Unlike other Mellow Wombat components, Mellow Heeler is not a dedicated shelf and relies upon Mellow Wombat to provide database storage, geographic locaation and time information, etc.

Originally deployed on Android devices, but current Android versions are broken for background processes.
